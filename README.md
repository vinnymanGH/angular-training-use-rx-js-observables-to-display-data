# Use RxJs Observables to Display Data

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, our lead developer decided to update `movies.service.ts` to make it return Observables instead of Signals.
As a result, we have to update our components to use Observables instead of Signals.

## Requirements
- Update `src/home/home.component.ts` to make it handle the new Observable and render the list of all movies.
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Remember the `async` pipe? Now is a good time to use it!
- Update `MovieDetailsComponent` to make it handle the new Observable and render movie details.
- The app should work just like it did before with no visible difference to the user.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
